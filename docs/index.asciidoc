=== Google Cloud Pub/Sub Output Plugin

include::{include_path}/plugin_header.asciidoc[]

==== Description

A LogStash plugin to upload log events to https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/[Google Cloud Pubsub].
Events are batched and uploaded in the background for the sake of efficiency.
Message payloads are serialized JSON representations of the events.

Example use-cases:

 * Stream events to Dataproc via Pub/Sub for real-time analysis.
 * Forward events from an on-prem datacenter to the LogStash in the cloud.
 * Use Pub/Sub as an scalable buffer to even out event flow between processing steps.

Note: While this project is partially maintained by Google, this is not an official Google product.

=== Environment Configuration

To use this plugin, you must create a
https://developers.google.com/storage/docs/authentication#service_accounts[service account]
and grant it the publish permission on a topic.
You MAY also use the https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/production[Application Default Credentials]
assigned to a compute instance.

The Pub/Sub topic __must__ exist before you run the plugin.
